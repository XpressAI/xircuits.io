# GPT Agent Toolkit

Welcome to the **GPT Agent Toolkit**! This toolkit provides a comprehensive set of Xircuits components that allow you to experiment with and create Collaborative Large Language Model-based automatons (Agents) in the style of [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT). By default, the toolkit comes with BabyAGI agents, but it is designed to be easily customizable with your own prompts.

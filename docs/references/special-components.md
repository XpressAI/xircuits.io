# Special Components

The following are special components in Xircuits.

## Comment Component
The comment component is a component that displays messages. Unlike normal components, you can add a Comment component via right-click context menu.

Execution-wise, the Comment component has no effect, it's purely a tooltip to help Xircuits users understand the workflow.

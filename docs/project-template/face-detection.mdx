# Face Detection

# Xircuits Face Detection Project Template

This template allows you to apply face detection on images or with webcam in real-time.

It consists of 2 components:

- [FaceDetector](https://github.com/XpressAI/x-template-face_detection/tree/main/xai_components/xai_face_detection/detector.py#L54): Face detection with popular face detectors. It takes folder or image as input and detects face with speficied backend (default: `mtcnn`). If folder, result will be saved in `output` folder besides the same directory provided, else, result will be saved at the root directory here (Check the message printed out at the terminal).

- [CamInference](https://github.com/XpressAI/x-template-face_detection/tree/main/xai_components/xai_face_detection/detector.py#L195): Camera inference with popular face detectors. It will open your webcam and detect face.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.9

If you would like to use `dlib` face detector: <br/>
- [Microsoft Visual Studio for C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-for-downloading-visual-studio-for-cplusplus/?sku=Community&rel=16&rid=30005) <br/>
(Note: Ignore the dlib installation error during installation if you want to skip this step. Also, avoid backend=2 or backend='dlib'.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/XpressAI/template-face_detection.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the required python packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run xircuits from the root directory

```
xircuits
```

## Workflow in this Template

### Inference

#### [FaceDetector.xircuits](https://github.com/XpressAI/x-template-face_detection/tree/main/xircuits-workflows/FaceDetector.xircuits)

<details>
<summary>Where to Provide Input?</summary>

Input is taken by `img_path` of Component `FaceDetector`. Check out the [example](#facedetector-example) below.

You may provide folder or image file as input. Relative path or absolute path both are accepted (Noted that your folder in path should be separated by `/`).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Backend Should I Use?</summary>

`RetinaFace` and `MTCNN` seems to overperform in detection but they are much slower. If the speed of your pipeline is more important, then you should use `opencv`, `ssd` or `mediapipe`. On the other hand, if you consider the accuracy, then you should use `retinaface`, `mtcnn` or `dlib`.

Recommended for inference: `retinaface`, `mtcnn` or `dlib`.

Available backend:
- 0 - opencv
- 1 - ssd
- 2 - dlib
- 3 - mtcnn
- 4 - retinaface
- 5 - mediapipe

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where to Find Output?</summary>

If your input is folder, the output folder will be located besides your input folder. \
Example:
- Input: `resource/sample`
- Output: `resource/output/sample`

If your input is image file, the output will be located in this github root directory (the same directory as this README) at `output.jpg` and `output.txt`.

<details>
<summary>Which Backend Should I Use?</summary>

Recommended for real-time inference: `opencv`, `ssd` or `mediapipe`.

Available backend:
- 0 - opencv
- 1 - ssd
- 2 - dlib
- 3 - mtcnn
- 4 - retinaface

### Possible Issue
1. Error to load weights while using 'ssd' backend <br/>
Details: `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\Users\\user_name/.deepface/weights'` <br/>
Solution: Restart Xircuits.

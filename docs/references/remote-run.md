# Remote Run

Remote run configuration can be viewed at `.xircuits/config.ini`. There are 3 separate section to fill which are:

- `REMOTE_EXECUTION`: The main run types
- `RUN_TYPES`: Each separate run type with its configuration
- `CONFIGURATION`: Each configuration data(Eg. name, command, url, msg). Required to be filled.


### Note:

Every time config.ini is updated, Xircuits only detect the change after changing run type on the toolbar.

# Types of Xircuits Components

Xircuits components enables users to perform complex ML workflows by simply dragging components to the panel and connecting them together. There are two types of components:

### General Components

These components are daily components such as String and Ints that you'll use in any Xircuits. They are hardbaked into the Xircuits distribution and you can use them out of the box. 

### Xircuits Library Components

These components rendered from Python components located at the `xai_component` directory. These components such as Keras and Spark have specific usages which users can pip install their packages separately through `requirements.txt`.

# Workflow Canvas

You can start the Xircuits workflow canvas in two ways:
1. Opening an existing .xircuits file.
2. Creating a new Xircuits canvas via launcher.

</details>

The following are the common canvas interfaces that you will use:

  1. [Xircuits Toolbar](#the-xircuits-toolbar)
  2. [Component Interfaces](#component-related-interfaces)
  3. [Link Interfaces](#link-related-interfaces)
  4. [Context Menu Interface](#right-click-context-menu)

### The Xircuits Toolbar

The Xircuits toolbar is displayed on top of every Xircuits canvas. From left to right:

![xircuits-toolbar](/img/docs/xircuits-toolbar.png)

1. **Undo**: Goes back one step.
2. **Redo**: Goes forward one step.
3. **Reload from Disk**: Reverts back to last saved point.
4. **Cut**: Cuts selected component(s) to clipboard.
5. **Copy**: Copies selected component(s) to clipboard.
6. **Paste**: Pastes component(s) from clipboard to canvas.
7. **Lock**: Locks all components in canvas. Locked components cannot be moved, linked-to nor deleted.
8. **Log**: Open Xircuits log window.
9. **Low Power Mode**: Toggle low power mode by disabling link animation.
10. **Reload All Nodes**: Reloads all nodes in the canvas. 
11. **Save**: Save current Xircuits canvas.
12. **Compile**: Codegens a Python script based on current canvas. 
13. **Save and Run**: Executes the generated Python script on the Python kernel based on Run Options.
13. **Xircuits Run Options**
    - **Local Run**: Saves, compiles, and executes Xircuits canvas locally.
    - **Run w/o Compile**: Saves current canvas but does not compile the Python script. Executes Python script with the same filename as the .xircuits file.
    - **Remote Run**: Saves, compiles, then performs a cmd-based remote run. Used often for Spark Submit. For more information, read [Remote Run](remote-run).

### Component Related Interfaces

Components are the gears of a Xircuits workflow which performs specific actions in sequence. Here's an example:

![xircuits-component-example](/img/docs/xircuits-component.png)

Each Xircuits components will usually have the following attributes:
  1. **Component Name:** A unique name that identifies the component. 
  2. **Flow [â–¶] Ports:** These ports indicate the sequence of the workflow. All flow ports must be connected from the `Start` Node to `Finish` Node.
  3. **Parameter Ports:** These ports modify the behavior of the library component. They can be linked by `Literal`, `Argument` components or by other library components. If the inPort has a `*` symbol, it is a `compulsory inPort`. Users *must* link the port with a parameter. 

There are a few additional interfaces for library components. They are located at top right corner of components. 

![xircuits-context-menu](/img/docs/xircuits-tooltip.png)

1. **Information Tooltip [ `i` ] :** Displays the component information tooltip, if any. In the Python component code, the comment is enclosed in the triple ''' ''' quotation marks. 
2. **Lock Component [ `ðŸ”’` ] :** Locks selected component. Locked components cannot be moved, linked-to nor deleted.

You are able to modify `Parameter Components` (Literal nodes and Argument nodes) by double clicking them.

### Link Related Interfaces

There are 2 types of links in Xircuits. 

  1. **Flow Links:** They indicate the sequence of a Xircuits workflow. Flow links are blue line flows connecting â–¶ ports which will turn solid yellow when highlighted.

  </details>

  2. **Parameter Links:** They indicate data flow from parameter component to library component, or from library component to another library component. Parameter links are grey in color and turn into a yellow flow when highlighted.

- Shift selecting will create a point in the link. Use it to route links so it's visually intuitive.

### Right Click Context Menu

The Xircuits context menu offers various options based on the selected entities on the canvas. You can open the context menu by right-clicking anywhere on the Xircuits canvas.

![xircuits-context-menu](/img/docs/xircuits-context-menu.png)
